# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables administrators to securely share quotation URLs with specific customers through a phone number verification system. When a customer accesses a shared quotation URL, they must verify their identity by entering the last four digits of their phone number, which must match the phone number stored in the quotation record. This ensures that only the intended customer can view their quotation, maintaining privacy and security while providing convenient access.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to generate a secure shareable URL for a quotation, so that I can send it to the specific customer without exposing it to unauthorized users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin selects a quotation THEN the system SHALL provide an option to generate a shareable URL
2. WHEN a shareable URL is generated THEN the system SHALL create a unique, non-guessable token for the quotation
3. WHEN a shareable URL is generated THEN the system SHALL include the quotation ID and verification token in the URL
4. WHEN a shareable URL is created THEN the system SHALL store the sharing status and timestamp in the quotation record

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to easily copy and share the quotation URL with my customer, so that I can quickly provide them access to their quotation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a shareable URL is generated THEN the system SHALL display the complete URL in a copyable format
2. WHEN the admin clicks the copy button THEN the system SHALL copy the URL to the clipboard
3. WHEN the URL is copied THEN the system SHALL show a confirmation message
4. WHEN the admin views the quotation THEN the system SHALL indicate if a shareable URL has been generated

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to access my quotation through a shared URL with phone verification, so that I can view my quotation securely without needing to log in.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a customer visits a shared quotation URL THEN the system SHALL display a phone verification form
2. WHEN the verification form is displayed THEN the system SHALL request the last four digits of the customer's phone number
3. WHEN the customer submits the verification form THEN the system SHALL validate the input format (4 digits only)
4. IF the verification form is empty or invalid THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
5. WHEN valid digits are submitted THEN the system SHALL compare them with the last four digits of the phone number stored in the quotation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to view my quotation after successful phone verification, so that I can review the details and pricing information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the phone verification succeeds THEN the system SHALL display the complete quotation details
2. WHEN the quotation is displayed THEN the system SHALL show all relevant information (items, pricing, customer details, etc.)
3. WHEN the quotation is displayed THEN the system SHALL use a customer-friendly view without admin controls
4. WHEN the customer views the quotation THEN the system SHALL log the access for audit purposes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system, I want to prevent unauthorized access to quotations, so that customer data remains secure and private.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN invalid phone digits are entered THEN the system SHALL deny access and display an error message
2. WHEN the verification token is invalid or expired THEN the system SHALL deny access with an appropriate error
3. WHEN a quotation does not have a phone number stored THEN the system SHALL prevent URL generation with an error message
4. WHEN multiple failed verification attempts occur THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
5. IF the quotation is not found or not shared THEN the system SHALL display a "not found" error

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to manage the sharing status of quotations, so that I can control access and revoke sharing when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin views a quotation THEN the system SHALL display the current sharing status
2. WHEN a quotation is already shared THEN the system SHALL provide an option to revoke sharing
3. WHEN sharing is revoked THEN the system SHALL invalidate the existing shareable URL
4. WHEN sharing is revoked THEN the system SHALL update the quotation record to reflect the change
5. WHEN a revoked URL is accessed THEN the system SHALL display an "access denied" message

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to track quotation sharing and access activities, so that I can monitor usage and ensure security compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a quotation URL is generated THEN the system SHALL log the sharing event with timestamp and admin user
2. WHEN a customer accesses a shared quotation THEN the system SHALL log the access event with timestamp and IP address
3. WHEN verification fails THEN the system SHALL log the failed attempt for security monitoring
4. WHEN sharing is revoked THEN the system SHALL log the revocation event with timestamp and admin user
